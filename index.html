    <h1>The mighty Amstaff</h1>
    <img src="images/juno-large.jpg" alt="mighty Amstaff named Juno">
    <p>The image above is a 2800px x 2100px JPEG file with minimal compression,
      making the file size 2.1MB. In this web page, the image is limited
      to a max width of 600px. In the Network tab of the Dev Tools, disable
      the cache and throttle the connection to a 3G or less speed to see
      the lag caused by large images.
    </p>
    <h2>An appropriate image size</h2>
    <p>The same image below is sized to 600px x 450px and is compressed at 80% for
      a file size of 33.2KB. If the connection is throttled down, this image won't load
      until the larger image loads. </p>
    <img src="images/juno-adjusted.jpg" alt="mighty Amstaff named Juno">
    <p>Also, with a slow connection, this text may "jump" down after the second
      images loads in some browsers because it wasn't assigned an aspect ratio in the CSS (this image is 4/3).
      It wasn't given height and width attributes in the HTML either, which would
      let the browser calculate the aspect ratio.
